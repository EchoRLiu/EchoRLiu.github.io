Huntington’s Disease (HD) is caused by an expanded CAG repeat in exon 1 of the Huntington (HTT) gene and pathological hallmarks of such disorders are the accumulation of protein aggregates in neurons and neuronal death. Phenotype such as choreatic movements or dementia does not appear until certain onset age. To understand the underlying pathological mechanisms prior to the onset, it is important to trace back developmental differences on molecular, synaptic, cellular, and network levels. Here we focus on the difference of protein synthesis dynamics between wild-type (WT) and mutant (MT) HD models. Previously, there have been extensive studies on the impact of MT HTT at DNA and protein levels. One key study (Krauß et al., 2013) established that HTT mRNA binds to MID1 at a rate proportional to the CAG repeat length, forming MID1-complex that also includes the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2Ac) and 40S ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K). Furthermore, the study showed that MT HTT protein level is increased compared to WT HTT. A proposed mechanism driving such changes in protein production dynamics is that the MID1-complex excites mTOR and inhibits PP2A nearby, subsequently activating bound ribosomes and eventually increasing the translation rate of MT HTT mRNA. However, the lack of existing research on the transcription process or measurement of mRNA level in MT HD models leaves us wondering: 1) is the change in WT or MT HTT protein level also caused by a change in mRNA level? and 2) if so, to what extent is the protein level change caused by transcription dynamics change and how much is caused by translation dynamics change?
