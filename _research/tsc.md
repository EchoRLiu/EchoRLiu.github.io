<!-- Memory and learning are fundamental to the brainâ€™s function and development, and they depend on communication across different brain areas through synapses. To ensure the proper synaptic function, neurons need to maintain a constant supply of proteins. Furthermore, the connection between neurons can be strengthened or weakened by modifying the protein composition via synaptic plasticity. Experimental work shows that proteins are often produced locally in the dendrites to quickly satisfy the protein requirement in response to synaptic activity.

Dysfunction of local translation has been associated with various symptoms of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability, caused by mutations of genes in signaling pathways that regulate local translation or translation initiation. To quantitatively understand how such mutations can lead to abnormal protein composition at synapses and cause impaired plasticity activity, we construct a data-driven model that elaborates the impact of the mutation on the local protein synthesis. This model can additionally serve as a computational framework that elucidates the most effective method of correcting the aberrant protein composition or treating such disorders. -->
