I am a Theoretical Neuroscience PhD student advised by [Dr. Tatjana Tchumatchenko](http://tchumatchenko.de/), affiliated with both University of Bonn and Univeristy of Mainz.

I work on protein dynamics in neurons that affect the synaptic plasticity and I study how such impact plays a role in network dynamics.

You can know more about my current research in the [research]({% link projects.md | https://echorliu.github.io/projects/ %}) section.
