I am a Theoretical Neuroscience PhD student working with [Prof. Dr. Tatjana Tchumatchenko](http://tchumatchenko.de/), affiliated with [Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences at University of Bonn](https://www.uni-bonn.de/en), [University of Bonn Medical Center](https://www.ukbonn.de/forschung/), and [University of Mainz Medical Center](https://www.unimedizin-mainz.de/forschung/uebersicht.html).

My research focuses on studying protein dynamics in neurons that affect synaptic plasticity and how such effect plays a role in network dynamics. I collaborate closely with [Prof. Dr. Sybille Krauss](https://biologie-uni-siegen.de/?mitarbeiter=prof-dr-sybille-krauss) and [Prof. Dr. Michael Schmeisser](https://www.unimedizin-mainz.de/anatomie/schmeisser-lab.html?L=1).
