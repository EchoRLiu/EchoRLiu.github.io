Hello! I am currently a Theoretical Neuroscience Ph.D. student at University of Bonn, working with [Prof. Tatjana Tchumatchenko](http://tchumatchenko.de/), with affiliation at [University of Bonn Medical Center](https://ieecr-bonn.de/).

My current research projects focus on the application of computational modeling to understand the progression of neurodegenerative diseases, with an emphasis on protein dynamics. I collaborate closely with [Prof. Sybille Krauss](https://biologie-uni-siegen.de/?mitarbeiter=prof-dr-sybille-krauss), [Prof. Michael Schmeisser](https://www.unimedizin-mainz.de/anatomie/schmeisser-lab.html?L=1), and [Prof. Susann Schweiger](https://lir-mainz.de/mitarbeiter/susann-schweiger).

I earned my M.S. from [Department of Applied Mathematics at University of Washington](https://amath.washington.edu) in 2021. I worked with [Prof. Douglas Martin](https://stat.uw.edu/about-us/people/doug-martin) on [robust Garch (robGarch) process modeling methods](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2020/projects/5815940211539968) and [Prof. Juris Vagners](https://www.aa.washington.edu/people/faculty/vagners) in [Autonomous Flight Systems Laboratory (AFSL)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCssJgVUpyQRk0PdvGtvKtyA), now Control & Trustworthy Robotics Lab (CTRL), on applying computer vision to unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for search and rescue missions.

You can know more about my current and past research in the [research]({% link _pages/research.md %}) section.
